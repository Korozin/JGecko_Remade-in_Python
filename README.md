# JGecko_Remade-in_Python


this is JGecko U completely remade in Python form. It included the ability to send Cafe codes, Assembly RAM memory writes and such. 
In order to run it, execute it like any other .py app/ "python example.py"

###  ~~There are dependancies you need to meet. The following Python modules are required!~~

~~pygame~~

~~PySimpleGUI~~

~~tkinter~~

~~mutagen~~

### ~~To install them do the following.~~


~~pip install pygame~~

~~pip install PySimpleGUI~~

~~pip install tkinter~~

~~pip install mutagen~~

Note: due to constant complaints about people not knowing how to install python modules (not really my fault they're dumb but ok) I've included the entire module folders in the main branch so all you need to to is press "Code" and then "Download.zip" to get all the files. Probably should say that since I included the entirety of the python modules the download will be a little beefy to say the least.

### This fact does not change how you run the program, you just unzip the .zip you get from downloading then run PyGecko.py.


## Known Errors

#### Some codes have invalid memory addresses. Sometimes this is due to it being sent in code form, try sending it via the memory viewer to see if the addresses properly displays.

#### Sometimes depending on the device the screen size can be out of proportion. To fix this in PyGecko.py go to line 407 where it states "window = sg.Window('PyGecko', layout, size=(720,400),background_color='#0d0d35',button_color=('#e4ecff','')).Finalize()" and edit where it says 720,400 to your desired window dimensions.
